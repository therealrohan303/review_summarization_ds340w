The ROKU Express is not a quality product. It doesn't respond to the controller, constantly lags / buffers and requires frequent restarts after becoming unresponsive. This is not an issue with my Internet or Wifi as this box sits 10 feet from by router and streaming from any other device does not suffer from the same quality issues. If your TV has a USB and HDMI port everything connects neatly and tidy. The cables and power supply (if needed) are included wonderful. I just bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad, It seems it has good reviews and I will
Great TV but beware of buying it on Amazon. Crisp picture, vivid colors, gorgeous look, real nice TV. However I made a mistake and bought on Amazon promotion that promised 15% back. Ordering the TV clicking on the advertisement promising the 15% discount, found eventually that I got only 5% back. After lengthy communication with Amazon, I was told that the discount did not apply when bought from third party seller. Why the whole purchase left me with bitter feelings towards whole Amazon and all Samsung products. From now will think twice on to order anything of value here.
They worked great while they worked, but now after only 8 months of use they have failed completely.
This is the best processor I've ever used.
The 5D MkIV is a great camera.
Great idea but brightness problem from some angles. Works well and fits snugly in my backpack. The only problem I have is that there is a lot of bleed-through. Looking at any down angle in portrait mode it looks too bright. Even looking at it straight on is an issue. The picture is actually best viewing from about 20 degrees below center. You can't turn the monitor upside-down in landscape mode, but in portrait you can adjust the angle so it looks good. The side angle doesn't seem to have this problem. This is ideal for a second monitor!.
It was great until it wasn’t. Love the smart TV options, HD was great and price was too good to be true. Now I’m a believer-for the weeks this TV worked, it was actually quite expensive! I came home last night and the TV wouldn’t come on. The blue light was illuminated, so I know it was getting power. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it’s totally dead now.
Great inexpensive way to add CarPlay to your vehicle. Uses a double DIN installation. I usedto install in my Jeep Wrangler JK. The upgrade even makes the speakers sound better. The included wired microphone works great with Siri. Highly Recommended!. This made my stock Bose system in my 2012 Nissan Altima coupe sound like a whole new system. It actually blew my mind when i heard the difference. Bass is insane, and head unit gives you a lot of control over the EQ settings and Bass Boost. Screen is very responsive, and Apple CarPlay works incredibly
I've been a loyal customer for many years - upgraded to the M1 a few months back, and all was great... until yesterday, when they turned on advertising banners. It now uses up a huge chunk of the space in the player app, and not only that, but the ads are animated, and a HUGE distraction while watching a show. This is not what I paid for, and adding this "feature" after the fact is shady at best, stupid to the extreme as their sales are about to drop like a rock as a result. I'll glad
Very nice lense for Portraits. Using it on my SL2. AF is fast but some times can't get a lock on dark objects. Manual focus also works nicely but you have to switch it to MF on the lens only then will it work. Can't use it for video work because no IS. These pics were taken only with my normal room light. Amazing deal. I've been using these lenses consistently for.
